  bio_content: "I work on optimization and networks at [Autonomous Mobility & Delivery team of Uber](https://www.uber.com/us/en/autonomous/). Previously, I was a postdoctoral research scientist at [Columbia IEOR](https://ieor.columbia.edu/) and [Data Science Institute](https://datascience.columbia.edu/), hosted by [Agostino Capponi](https://www.columbia.edu/~ac3827/). In 2024, I received PhD in [MS&E](https://msande.stanford.edu/) with PhD Minor in [Statistics](https://statistics.stanford.edu/) from Stanford. I was fortunate to be advised by [Markus Pelger](https://mpelger.people.stanford.edu/) as a member of the [Advanced Financial Technologies Lab](https://fintech.stanford.edu/)."

  research_title: "Research brief"
  research_content: "I develop statistical methods for inference in large dimensional time series data to make better decisions. My goal is to design useful tools merging econometrics and Transformer-based ML. My current work includes graph neural networks applications in [supply chains](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5031617) and learning in non-stationary environment."
