1. **Selective Multiple Testing: Inference for Large Panels with Many Covariates** [(Paper)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4315891) [(Code)](https://github.com/jiachzou/panel_multiple_testing) [(Slides)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14fSXYmFJxZBjXuSz0eOscAtF8ggx1ugg/view?usp=share_link) <br>

    - _R&R at Management Science_.
    - We propose Panel Multiple Testing that allows us to select covariates that explain a large cross-section with false discovery control. In our empirical asset pricing study, we select sparse risk factors from a factor zoo of 114, to explain 243 doubly-sorted portfolio excess returns.

2. **Large Dimensional Change Point Detection with FWER Control as Automatic Stopping** [(Paper)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15SotyMqpWBUTrwaCpzNGron2F4uz1wdL/view?usp=sharing) [(Poster)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14xcom92GMaCcFZpjLXblOc4K5FlCr6rP/view?usp=sharing) [(Code)](https://github.com/yfan7/panel_CPD) <br>

    - With hundreds of time series and unknown number of change points to detect, our inference-based method is better suited than the classical DP-based algorithm due to its conscientious trade-off of Type I vs Type II error. We provide FWER control theory. In simulations, we showed 20% lift in F1 scores against leading benchmarks.

4. **Asset pricing with Supply Chain Relationships** [(Paper)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5031617) [(Code)](https://github.com/agcappo/SupplyChainAssetPricing) <br>
	Co-authors: Agostino Capponi, Jose Sidaoui <br>
  - We develop a nonparametric method to aggregate firm characteristics across a large supply chain network to explain cross-sectional expected returns. Each firm receives a pricing signal, nonlinearly constructed from the characteristics of neighboring firms within d-hops on the network. We find that $d = 3$ – encompassing network effects up to the third order – balances bias reduction from higher-order relations against variance from added complexity. Our model leads to a portfolio sorted by ML-driven firm-level estimated returns that condition on both historical supply chain data and firm characteristics. We achieve over a 16% out-of-sample Sharpe gain vs direct-link models, and outperform the Fama–French five-factor and PCA benchmarks. We find that the ML-managed portfolio improves mean-variance efficiency, measured by Sharpe ratio. Lastly, we show that the conditional mean return estimation of more central firms is 55% more sensitive to missingness of supply chain links compared to that of peripheral firms in the supply chain graph.
