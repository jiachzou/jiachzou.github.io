__Bio__    

I work on [Autonomous Mobility & Delivery at Uber](https://www.uber.com/us/en/autonomous/). Previously, I was a postdoctoral research scientist at [Columbia IEOR](https://ieor.columbia.edu/) and [Data Science Institute](https://datascience.columbia.edu/), hosted by [Agostino Capponi](https://www.columbia.edu/~ac3827/). In 2024, I received PhD in [MS&E](https://msande.stanford.edu/) with PhD Minor in [Statistics](https://statistics.stanford.edu/) from Stanford. I was fortunate to be advised by [Markus Pelger](https://mpelger.people.stanford.edu/) as a member of the [Advanced Financial Technologies Lab](https://fintech.stanford.edu/). <br>

Doctoral dissertation committee: [Markus Pelger](https://mpelger.people.stanford.edu/), [Kay Giesecke](https://giesecke.people.stanford.edu/), [Itai Ashlagi](https://web.stanford.edu/~iashlagi/), [Han Hong](https://profiles.stanford.edu/han-hong), [Jann Spiess](https://gsb-faculty.stanford.edu/jann-spiess/). <br>

__Research brief__    

I develop statistical methods for inference in large dimensional data sets to make better decisions. My domain knowledge of financial economics and machine learning informs my methodological work. 

I identify [a new class of multiple testing problems in panel data learning](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4315891), which is broadly applicable. In a sequence of follow-up papers, I use this framework for latent graphs learning and change point detection in time-series. My current work includes graph neural networks applications in [global supply chain](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5031617), sequential learning in non-stationary environment, and semi-parametric statistics for financial market microstructure.
